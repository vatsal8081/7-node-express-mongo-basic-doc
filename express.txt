1) there are multiple way we can create and manage the structure of express app but we also have express-generator which we 
can use to create different type of express apps with different configurations and structures so explore express-generator
you will find it usefully maybe to create basic express app boilerplate and structure  

2) we can serve static files from the express.static middleware but if we want to server multiple folders from project as
static then we can call the static middleware twice like this 

app.use(express.static('public'))
app.use(express.static('files'))

3) after learning food express you can visit the more examples tab in express to get examples of how we can achive
some of well known backend tasks like auth, download, mvc etc.

4) express handles endpoint not found by them self like if we don't have any endpoint which user visit the express will
automatically send it's own 404 response but if you want to override it you can add one middleware at very end and make sure
that this middleware only execute when we don't go in any endpoint or middleware and you can send 404 from there. 
because anyway if request is not able to go in any route handler the that mins it's 404 just make sure it should be 
last middleware from your app nothing can come after this like this 

app.use((req, res, next) => {
  res.status(404).send("Sorry can't find that!")
})
